# Student Validation & Table App

A simple web-based JavaScript project that allows you to manage student data with real-time validation and dynamic table display.

This project consists of **three mini tasks**, combined into one user-friendly app.
---
 Task 1: Add Student to Table
- Users can input:
  - Student **Name**
  - Unique **ID**
  - **Age**
- Upon clicking “Add Student”, a new row appears in the student table with the entered data.
---
Task 2: Input Validation

Before adding a student, the form validates the following:
- All fields must be **filled**
- Name must be at least **3 characters**
- ID and Age must be **numbers**
- The **ID must be unique**
---
 Task 3: Error Messages under Inputs
- Error messages are shown **below the input fields** using `<span>` elements.
- No `alert()` popups used — cleaner user experience.
